          <strong>Duration and Convexity of Bonds with Embedded Options</strong><br>
          Have you ever wondered how reliable are bond risk measures when your fixed-income investment is callable or putable?
          Risk measures of bonds with embedded options are sensitive to changes in the underlying economic and financial conditions. This is because the value and behavior of these investment, can be affected by factors such as changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and volatility. As a result, standard risk measures for these types of bonds are difficult to predict and require sophisticated modeling techniques. The exact level of sensitivity will depend on the specifics of the bond, including the type and terms of the embedded options.
          I have developed a lattice-based short-rate model that calibrates and predicts the duration and convexity of bonds with embedded options.

          <strong>YARA - Yet Another Robo-Advisor</strong><br>
          Todays financial-advisor AIs are poorly conceived. In contrast, a successful advisory follows a very simple principle that having more money is always better than having less money. I have programmed a robo-advisor that does this job better and cheaper than existing software - and even humans. It automatically analyzes financial market data and transaction costs that are too complex for a human. The code is able to make forecasts of a quality that only the big investment banks and hedge funds are able to afford. Under the hood, it uses state-of-the-art methods to automatically calculate the optimal (Markowitz) portfolio, perfectly tailored to the client's preferences. It boils down the results and prints out a "recipe" for the client to cook — a list of two to three financial securities that the client only needs to buy.
