      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Duration and Convexity of Bonds with Embedded Options</strong><br>
          Have you ever wondered how reliable are bond risk measures when your fixed-income investment is callable or putable?
          Risk measures of bonds with embedded options are sensitive to changes in the underlying economic and financial conditions. This is because the value and behavior of these investment, can be affected by factors such as changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and volatility. As a result, standard risk measures for these types of bonds are difficult to predict and require sophisticated modeling techniques. The exact level of sensitivity will depend on the specifics of the bond, including the type and terms of the embedded options.
          I have developed a lattice-based short-rate model that calibrates and predicts the duration and convexity of bonds with embedded options.

          <strong>Simple Robo-Advisor</strong><br>
Many financial advisors are poorly trained. As a result, financial advisory firms waste too much time and money selling dubious products to their clients (which both often do not understand themselves). They end up inadvertently burning their clients' money and their own money. In contrast, a successful advisory follows the simple principle that having more money is always better than having less money. I have programmed a robo-advisor that does this job better and cheaper than an human. In contrast to a human financial advisor, who must stay incentivized in order to work, this software does not require this costly form of compensation. It automatically analyzes financial data that can be too large and complex for a human. The code is able to make forecasts of a quality that only the big investment banks and hedge funds were able to afford before. Under the hood, it uses state-of-the-art methods to automatically calculate the optimal (Markowitz) portfolio, perfectly tailored to the client's preferences. It then boils down the results and prints out a "recipe" for the client to cook—a list of two to three financial securities that the client only needs to buy. This "fire and forget" investment list is a win-win situation for institutions like banks and their clients. With today's technology, financial advisory is just repetitive work that can be automated. The code transforms your financial advisory firm to cost leadership. Making money—aka, not burning money—is as simple as that.
